# Developing Generative AI Applications on AWS v2.x - Lab 3: Develop conversation pattern with Amazon Bedrock APIs an hour

In this lab, you explore how to use the Amazon Nova Lite model through Amazon Bedrock API for intelligent question answering. You first examine the limitations of zero-shot prompting, and then learn how to enhance response accuracy by providing relevant context. This lab demonstrates both complete and streaming response generation methods, simulating a simplified version of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enterprise-level question answering systems.
